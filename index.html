         I grew up in Lombard, Illinois, about an hour away from Chicago. Growing up, I loved to
         play soccer and videogames like Counter-Strike. In highschool, I became interested in tennis 
         and found my passion for coding and computers. I went to the College of Dupage where I played tennis
         went to nationals my last year. I moved to Texas in 2022 to persue my computer science degree at Austin College.
